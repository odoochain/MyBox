### Geography Code<a id="geographyCode" />
1. Data definition：
	-  Basical attributes: id, level, longitude, latitude, chinese_name, english_name, 5 codes, 5 aliases,
	-  Subordinate: owner, continent, country, province, city, county, town, village, building. ("Ancestors")
	-  Auxiliary attributes: altitute, precision, coordinate system, area(square meters), population, comments, isPredefined.
2. Data constraints:
 	-  Not null values: id, level,  chinese_name or english_name.
 	-  Values of "level": global(only "Earth"), continent, country, province(state), city, county(district), town, village(neighborhood), building, point of interest.
 	-  Data is unnecessary to be subordinated level by level. Cross-over can happen.
           Example, a village is subordinated to Antarctica, and a city belongs to a country without province level.
	-  Match data:
 	  	- One of following can determine an address:
 	  	 	- Match “id"(assigned by MyBox automatically). This is accurate matching.
 	  	 	- Match "level" + ancestors + "chinese_name"/"english_name"/any one "alias". This is accurate matching.
 	  	 	- Match "level" + "chinese_name"/"english_name"/any one "alias". This is fuzzy matching. Duplicated names in same level can cause false matching.
 	  	- Matching of name or alias is case-insensitive.
 	  	- Sometimes 5 "code" are useful to match data.
3. Edit data：
 	-  "subordinate" of data is set by selecting node in locations tree.
 	-  "level" of data should be lower than its ancestors.
 	-  Data must have either chinese_name or english_name.
 	-  Select or display coordinate in map.
 	-  Set as "Predefined data" or "Inputted data" against selected rows.

 	  	- Match id, which is assigned by MyBox automatically. This is accurate matching.
  	  	- Match "dataSet" + "date" + "location". This is accurate matching.
	- This version assumes that only one valid data in each day for same dataSet plus same location.
3. Edit data：
 	-  When in single data, location is set by selecting node from locations tree.
 	-  In interface of "Epidemic Reports of Chinese Provinces" or  "Epidemic Reports of Countries", multiple rows can be inputted for same dataSet and time.

# MyBox: Set of Easy Tools
This is desktop application based on JavaFx to provide simple and easy functions. It's free and open sources.

## What's New                       
2023-1-21 v6.7                
                                
* Added features:                  
     - Group data by same values of century/year/month/day/hour/minute/second of a time column.                                               
     - Group data by same results of row expressions.                                                                    
     - Charset can be set for "Run System Command".                                                                     
     - Document "Stories of Images".                                                                  
* Improved codes:                  
     - Grouping parameters are saved in database instead of in memory.                                               
     - In data formats, hour/minute/second are always long values.                                                                     
     - Rename internal images.                                                                  
 * Solved problems:                       
     - When group by value ranges of time column, ranges should be displayed as time rather than as long.                                               
     - When group by conditions, all values should be imported in temprory table, or else results may be wrong.                                                           
     - When group by rows number, split number is wrongly picked as split size.

### Other addresses to download
Download from cloud storage: [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fWMRzym_jh075OCX0D8y8A#list/path=%2F](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fWMRzym_jh075OCX0D8y8A#list/path=%2F)               
Download from sourceforge: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mara-mybox/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mara-mybox/files/)             

## Limitation        
* Without enough testings, MyBox has low reliability. Data damage even happened in some versions.       
* New functions being added and codes being improved continually, MyBox has bad stability. Unexpected function failures happened sometimes.       
* MyBox windows may often be blocked when some Input Method is running. Workaround is to disable/uninstall this Input Method.        

## Migration
1. Each version has itself's configuration file. New version can copy parameters from existed versions.             
2. Data handled in each version are under "Data Directory" referred by it. Multiple versions can refer to same data directory.
3. MyBox is backward compatibility: Later version can work on data of previous versions.
While forward compatibility is not supported: Wrong may happen when old version handles data of new version.


## Configuration <a id="Config"></a>
Configuration file is under "User Home":        

| Platform | Path of MyBox Configuration File |        
| --- | --- |
| win | `C:\users\UserName\mybox\MyBox_v6.7.ini`  |
| linux | `/home/UserName/mybox/MyBox_v6.7.ini` |
| mac | `/Users/UserName/mybox/MyBox_v6.7.ini` |        

Add parameter "config=\"FilePath\"" when run jar to change configuration file temporarily.        
Function "Settings" can be used to change configuration values.
